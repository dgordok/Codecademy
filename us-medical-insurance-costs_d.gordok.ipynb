The record holder here is again Southeast: ***~67%*** of people in this region can be defined as obese, and overall ***~89%*** have excessive weight. At the same time, Southeast has also the lowest proportion of people who are in the healthy weight range on the bmi scale: ***~11%***. In addition to the previous findings, this information helps to understand better why the insurance costs in Southeast are higher on average."

    "The analysis has been successfully completed. The four regions available in the data set were studied: ***Northeast***, ***Northwest***, ***Southeast*** and ***Southwest***. The number of observations for each of them is the following: ***324*** for Northeast, ***325*** for Northwest, ***325*** for Southwest and ***364*** for Southeast. Each region has ***~ 50% / 50%*** ratio of men and women and ***~ 50% / 50%*** ratio of younger (under 40 y.o.) and older (40 y.o. or more) people. More than half of the insured persons in each region have children: ***~55%-59%***.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the four regions available for analysis, Southeast has the highest average value of medical insurance costs. In addition, given the fact that the sample size is slightly larger for this region, its data spread is also higher: the standard deviation value is the highest and the min and max values are the most polarized compared to other regions. The higher rate of charges in Southeast can be explained by the fact that this region has the highest percentage of smokers (***25%***), the highest percentage of overweight people in general (***~89%***) and obese people in particular (***~67%***). \n",
    "However, it is not known what factors determine the medical insurance costs, nor how relevant each of the factors is: it is likely that there are also other determinants that are not present in the dataset. Moreover, nothing is known about the real nature of the data provided for the analysis: this is evident from the overly generic names of the regions.\n",
